                <h3>Site Mapping</h3>
                <p>
                    This is one of my favorite parts of UX/UI. By looking at the navigation in a sitemap, it makes it easier to see redundant links. This is also helpful to create different sitemaps and do user testing to see which navigation system is most intuitive.

                <h3>Wirefames</h3>
                <p>
                    While I enjoy all types of wireframing, digital mockups at the low fidelity level is my preferred stage. Creating a general design and playing around with different layouts to see which one works best not only improves user experience, but also helps to save time in later stages of design.

                <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    With usability testing, I prefer to be the facilitator, guiding the person through the interview. Once the data has been collected, I use it to update the sitemap and wireframes to reflect the outcomes.
